## General info

Each year I have a goal for the number of books acquired vs read, to try and whittle down my to read list. And try and prevent me from buying too many books (Kobo selling books for 99p has a lot of answer for). Although the json files in here were created from my original spreadsheet, I cut the list down a lot because it was hard to check if the numbers were the same.
